# Battleship
Simple battleship game against a computer or another player. 

Settings determine number of players and ships per player.

Place your ships on the board then take turns attempting to sing your opponents ships. 

QUESTIONS/CONSIDERATIONS:
- Some functions used just to ensure user input is correct (using while/if). Is this the best way?
- Ships are currently just 1x1 size. Look at implementing ship classes with varying sizes.
